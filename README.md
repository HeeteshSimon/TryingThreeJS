# TryingThreeJS
The aim of the project is to create an easy to use, lightweight, 3D library with a default WebGL renderer.<br> 
The library also provides Canvas 2D, SVG and CSS3D renderers in the examples.

## Library Used:
[ThreeJS Library](https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js)

## Installation
You can install three.js with npm and modern build tools, or get started quickly with just static hosting or a CDN.
For most users, installing from npm is the best choice. Whichever you choose, be consistent and import all files from the same version of the library.
Mixing files from different sources may cause duplicate code to be included, or even break the application in unexpected ways. <br>
For Installing refer the [CDN](https://threejs.org/docs/#manual/en/introduction/Installation) of ThreeJS.
